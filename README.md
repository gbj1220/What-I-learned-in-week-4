# ***What I learned in week 4***

## **Loops**

### **While Loops:**

* *a way to run a specified section of code multiple times with one function*

* *runs the code based upon whether a specified statement is true or false*

* *runs the code until the statement becomes false*?

### **For Loops:**
* *another way to run a specified section of code multiple times with one function*

* *runs the code based upon a counting variable*

* *when a specified number reaches another specified number to loop is complete and stops*

### **Indices:**

#### **Indices in a String**
* *the indices of a string are the actual characters* 

* [0] *will be the first character of the string*

* [1] *will be the second character of the string and so on*

#### **Indices of an Array**

* *the indices of an array are the actual elements of your array*

* [0] *will be the first element of the array*

* [1] *will be the second element of the array and so on*

## **Arrays:**
* *An array is essentially a list of the elements in an array*
* *There are lots of ways to manipulate an array*


| **Function**   |                                **Result**                                     |      
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|**.Push()**     |*adds value to end of array*                                                   |
|**.Pop()**      |*removes last item of array*                                                   |
|**.shift()**    |*deletes first item in Array & then moves everything over one spot to the left*|
|**.unshift()**  |*adds item to beginning of array*                                              |

## **Map Operations:**
* makes a new array that has the same amount of elements as the original
* each element has been changed in some way
* changes the way the page is presented, such as shortening names on Slack
* Ex... when Spotify shows you what songs your friends are listening to
